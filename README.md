# image-processing-for-medical-applications
Welcome to my coding playground! This repo is where I stash all the code I'm messing around with for my PhD. Itâ€™s all about experimenting with different deep learning algorithms to make sense of medical images. The goal? To uncover cool insights that could help make healthcare a bit better. Dive in, explore, and feel free to share your thoughts!
